        Having no layout whatsover is almost ok if all you want is one big column of content. However, if a user makes the browser window really wide, it gets kind of annoying to read: after each line your eyes have a long distance to travel right-to-left to the next line. Try resizing your browser to see what I mean! Before we fix this problem, let's make sure we're clear on the very important display property.
