    <div>
        <p class="static">
        A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div >
        <p class="relative1">
        relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.

    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="relative2">
        Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="fixed">
        A fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

    <div>
        <p class="absolute">
        This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned relative to its parent.
